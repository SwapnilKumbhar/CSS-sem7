### Foot notes
This is purely an experimental design for academic purposes. By no means with today's standards is this a secure implementation or design that can be practically used in any imaginable application small or big. **DO NOT USE THIS IN PURPOSES OTHER THAN ACADEMIC**. 

That'll be it. Any suggestion with regard to design or implementation are welcome. Peace.
